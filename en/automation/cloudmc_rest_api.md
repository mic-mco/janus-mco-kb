This article introduces the TIGO MCO REST API and provides details on how to access it.

## Summary

As an API-driven orchestration platform, TIGO MCO provides access to all functions through its REST API. Any function that you have access to through the web user interface can be accessed through the API endpoints. All API calls are secured through HTTPS connections and with an API key that is unique to your account.

## API key and endpoint

To use the TIGO MCO API, you will need to log in to the system and create an API key for your requests. The following article provides the steps to create a new API key:

- [Generate a CloudMC API key](../how-to/how-to-cloudmc-api-key.md)

In addition to the API keys, the **API credentials** page will also list the URL to use when connecting to an endpoint.
