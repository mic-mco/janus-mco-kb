1. **Menu bar**

    At the top, the menu bar is displayed, which is available at all times. In it, you will find all the platform's functions grouped into categories such as services, activities, reports, among others. You can interact with them at any time as long as you have an active session on the platform. The options adjust to each user depending on the role and privileges assigned.

2. **Workspace**

    The workspace is the main section of all TIGO MCO screens. The elements visible in the workspace are determined by the context of your location in the system. For example, on the home page shown here, you can find the service map, system status, and recent activity.

3. **Organization picker**

    TIGO MCO is a platform that allows the management of multiple organizations grouped under a single main organization; for example, a multinational company can have sub-organizations associated with geographical locations. The organization selector allows you to navigate between the organizations and sub-organizations to which you have access.

4. **Control options**

    On the right side of the menu bar are three elements: the help menu, the notifications menu, and the user menu. Under these elements, you can receive messages about your provisioning tasks or important messages issued by TIGO, access the knowledge base, manage your personal data, and log out of the platform.
