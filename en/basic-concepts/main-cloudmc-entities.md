TIGO MCO has been designed under a hierarchical grouping model that allows for agile and secure provisioning and management of cloud services. The following is a list of the solution's main components.

### TIGO MCO entities

- **Organization:** This is the primary logical grouping in the system and includes services, environments, resources, and users. An organization can contain sub-organizations, as might be the case for a multinational company.

- **Service:** Allows interaction with virtual resources located in multiple geographical locations and with different cloud service providers.

- **Environment:** This is the logical unit within an organization used to securely isolate and group resources. It is equivalent to virtual data centers in TIGO Cloud 360 or an account in AWS.

- **Resources:** These are the final components that can be provisioned and managed. Examples include virtual servers, virtual networks, storage disks, and virtual network cards, among others.

- **Permission:** This refers to an authorization to execute a particular task.

- **Role:** This is a named collection of permissions that govern access to functionality within the TIGO MCO console, as well as access to service resources.
