1.  **List of buckets**

    In the main area of the workspace, a list of all buckets in the selected environment appears.

2.  **Search box**

    Type in the search box to filter the bucket list. The system will search through the bucket name, region, and URL fields, and returns any bucket that matches the string in the search box.

3.  **Preset filters**

    Select one or more preset filters from this drop-down menu to limit the list of buckets to those that match the selected filters. If there is a string in the search box, the system will only display filters that are relevant to the results of that search. Clear the search box to make all preset filters available.

4.  **Add bucket**

    Clicking this button will open the **Add bucket** page.

5.  **Bucket entry**

    Each entry includes the name of the bucket, the AWS region where it is located, the URL that can be used to access the bucket via the API, the date the bucket was created, and the access permissions that have been set on the bucket. Click on an entry to navigate to page which lists the contents of that bucket.

6.  **Hidden Actions menu**

    Each entry in the bucket list has a Hidden Actions menu. Click on the Hidden Actions menu to access a list of frequently-used operations for the bucket.
