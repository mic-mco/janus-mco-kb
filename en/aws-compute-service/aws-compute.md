1. **List of instances**

    In the main area of the workspace, a list of all instances in the selected environment appears.

2. **Search box**

    Type in the search box to filter the instance list. The system will search through the instance name and the subnetwork fields, and returns any instance that matches the string in the search box.

3. **Add instance**

    Clicking this button will open the **Add instance** wizard.

4. **Instance details**

    Each entry includes the name of the instance, the instance type, its state, the subnetwork the instance is attached to, and the date the instance was created. Click on an entry to navigate to a page with configuration details, graphs of resource consumption, and a list of all operations for that individual instance.

5. **Actions menu**

    Each entry in the instance list has a Hidden Actions menu. Click on the Hidden Actions menu to access a list of frequently-used operations for the instance.
