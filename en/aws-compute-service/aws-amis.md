Amazon Web Services provides pre-defined images, called Amazon Machine Images, to be used when creating new instances on the AWS platform. At a minimum, an AMI contains the operating system required to boot a new virtual machine. There is a wide variety of AMIs to choose from, and some may contain software applications already installed for your convenience.

Your CloudMC administrator has provided a set of AMIs that you may select from when adding a new instance. On the **Add instance** page, you will specify which AMI to use. An image may have different versions available. Click on the triangle beneath the name of the image to open a menu with the available versions.

AMIs are listed on the **Add instance** page, under the **Choose an image** section.
